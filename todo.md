## Todo List

- [ ] Phase 1: Research network monitoring and hotspot creation requirements
  - [x] Research Python libraries for network monitoring (device discovery, packet capture)
  - Scapy seems promising for network monitoring and packet capture.
  - [x] Research methods for creating a local hotspot programmatically in Python
  - Direct programmatic hotspot creation in Python is complex and platform-dependent. It might be better to rely on existing system utilities or manual setup for the hotspot, and focus Python on network monitoring.
- [x] Phase 2: Design application architecture and select appropriate libraries
  - Created Flask application structure
  - Selected Scapy for network monitoring and psutil for system info
  - Designed API endpoints and data structure
- [x] Phase 3: Implement network device discovery and monitoring functionality
  - Created device model with packet tracking
  - Implemented network scanner using Scapy for ARP discovery
  - Added packet monitoring and statistics tracking
  - Created API routes for device management and monitoring
- [x] Phase 4: Create web interface for displaying device information and packet statistics
  - Created modern responsive HTML interface with real-time updates
  - Implemented CSS styling with gradient backgrounds and animations
  - Added JavaScript for API communication and dynamic content updates
  - Included device cards, statistics overview, and control panel
- [x] Phase 5: Test the application locally and prepare deployment instructions
  - Successfully tested Flask application on localhost:5002
  - Verified web interface loads correctly with modern design
  - Tested network scanning and monitoring functionality
  - Created comprehensive deployment instructions for MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Phase 6: Deliver the complete application with documentation
